# The past, present and future of JavaScript engines

A presentation I presented at Node+JS Interactive 2019 in Montreal, Canada where I go through the history of VMs and JavaScript engines in particular, explaining about the historical context I believe it made move things into the path we're on today. On a brief note I also talk about what I think we can expect for the short future. Check the [slides here](https://slides.com/a0viedo/the-past-present-and-future-of-js-engines).
